          <h4 class="title-blue">What is CodeQuiz?</h4>
          <p>CodeQuiz is a learning tutor for programmers. CodeQuiz's lessons are based on information provided by the w3c and library developers. The quizzes will test your knowledge of the library or framework"s methods and help you learn new ones.</p>

          <h4 class="title-blue">How does practicing help me learn?</h4>
          <p>One of the main bottlenecks when learning a new language is understanding the methods and classes. CodeQuiz intentionally focuses on helping you learn the vocabulary of a new language through reptitive practice.</p>

              <h4 class="title-blue">How is CodeQuiz different than other options?</h4>
              <p>CodeQuiz does two things differently. First, there are specific and correct answers to questions so you can track your progress unlike traditional flash card models. Second, the questions have tiered difficulty requiring you to understand the material in practice.</p>

              <h4 class="title-blue">Can't I just learn a language's vocabulary while programming?</h4>
              <p>Unfortunately, while programming we tend to use tools we are familiar with rather than spending time to learn new tools. And when an experienced programmer learns a new langauge she tends to use the strategies from other known langauges rather than learning the tools which make a new language powerful.</p>
