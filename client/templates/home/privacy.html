      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>Like most website operators, CodeQuiz collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. CodeQuiz’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how CodeQuiz’s visitors use its website. From time to time, CodeQuiz may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>

      <p>CodeQuiz also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. CodeQuiz does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
      </p>

      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>Certain visitors to CodeQuiz’s websites choose to interact with CodeQuiz in ways that require CodeQuiz to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that CodeQuiz gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, CodeQuiz collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with CodeQuiz. CodeQuiz does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
      </p>

      <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

      </p>

      <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>CodeQuiz discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on CodeQuiz’s behalf or to provide services available at CodeQuiz’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using CodeQuiz’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. CodeQuiz will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, CodeQuiz discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when CodeQuiz believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of CodeQuiz, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a CodeQuiz website and have supplied your email address, CodeQuiz may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with CodeQuiz and our products.
